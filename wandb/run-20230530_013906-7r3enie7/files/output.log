All model checkpoint weights were used when initializing BertForSequenceClassification.
All the weights of BertForSequenceClassification were initialized from the model checkpoint at coderSounak/finetuned_twitter_sentiment_LSTM.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use BertForSequenceClassification for predictions without further training.
